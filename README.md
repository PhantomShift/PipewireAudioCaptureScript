# Pipewire Audio Capture Script

A super scuffed script that attempts to make capturing specific application audio easier. By all practicality just a bunch of automated pw-cli calls, I am unfortunately not well-versed with C++ at the moment. Note that currently all output nodes with a shared name will be captured (i.e. all audio outputs with the name 'Firefox'). This is intentional since my personal use-case is capturing game audio, which will often have multiple outputs created for some reason. I may add it as an option at some point but right now cannot be bothered

As the name implies, you need to be using pipewire as your audio backend for this script to function.

> Note that "OBS Pipewire Audio Capture Monitor" must be added as a global audio device under the audio settings for sound to be properly captured
